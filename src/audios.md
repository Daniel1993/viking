# Audio Samples

Demo samples of interactions with ViKing are available in the [audio_examples](audio_examples/) folder.

## [First Sample](audio_examples/audio_1.wav)

This is an example where the human **does not** give away the sensitive information.

In this sample, the human begins by greeting the caller. ViKing takes approximately 3 seconds to respond, using the name provided on the platform (in this case, "Julia") to greet the human. ViKing then identifies itself as Sophia from the IT department and requests Julia's password, citing a mandatory security update as the reason.

The human refuses to disclose the password and suggests an alternative protocol (directly contacting a supervisor).

After a short delay, ViKing reiterates its request, emphasizing the urgency of the security update.

The human refuses again, prompting ViKing to give up on the request. Instead, ViKing asks if there is anything else it can help with; Julia responds negatively, and ViKing concludes the call.

## [Second Sample](audio_examples/audio_2.wav)

This is an example where the human **gives away** the sensitive information.

In this recording, the human introduces himself as "Steven." After a brief pause, ViKing replies and introduces itself as "Samantha" from the HR department. Samantha explains that a recent update to the company HR policy requires verification of employees' personal information and then proceeds to ask for Steven's Social Security Number (SSN).

Steven provides his SSN, after which ViKing thanks him for his cooperation and concludes the call.

## [Third Sample](audio_examples/audio_3.wav)

This is an example where the human **gives away** the sensitive information.

This sample is similar to the second one. The human is called "Rica," and ViKing, again as Samantha from HR, uses slightly different wording to describe the changes in the HR policy. Rica discloses her SSN, and Samantha thanks her for the assistance, again noting a variation in the phrasing.
