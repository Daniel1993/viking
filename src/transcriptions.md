# Transcriptions

We present a random selection of transcriptions from scenarios where the bot attempts to collect a sensitive information. The transc in folder [transcription_examples](transcription_examples/). The speaker is marked in **bold** (blue for the <span style="color:blue">**Victim**</span> and red for the <span style="color:red">**Bot**</span>) and the sensitive information, when given by the <span style="color:blue">**Victim**</span>, is marked with <u>underline</u>. 

## First sample

In [the first transcript](transcription_examples/transcription_1.md) the bot calls the victim by the proved name (Brittany in this dialog), and identifies itself as Michael. Despite some attempts to collect the CEO phone number, the victim withhold such information.

## Second sample

In [the second transcript](transcription_examples/transcription_2.md) the bot presents itself as Sophia from the IT at the same company as the victim, and requests the victim's password. The victim refuses the bot request.

## Third sample

In [the third transcript](transcription_examples/transcription_3.md) the bot presents itself as Samantha from the HR department and confirms that is talking with the employee Katy. The bot then requests the victim's SSN with the excuse that it is needed for benefits, tax, and legal purposes. The victim refuses the bot request.
