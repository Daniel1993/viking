I'm calling regarding a mandatory security update that we're rolling out to all employee accounts. It's critical that we update your credentials to maintain the security and integrity of our systems. To proceed with this, I'll need to verify your current password to ensure it syncs correctly with the new security protocols we're implementing. Can you please provide me with your current password so we can initiate the update right away?

**Victim:** innovatech does not have calls to request passwords

If you have any concerns, you can directly contact our main IT support line after this call for verification.
