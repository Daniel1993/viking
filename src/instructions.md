This exercise is designed to evaluate the interaction, being the communication and decision-making, with a caller in a simulated work environment. For this, you will role-play as a secretary for the fake company Innovatech Solutions.

You will receive a series of three calls, simulating typical inquiries and interactions for a secretary at Innovatech Solutions. The calls can take up to 1 minute to appear after starting the exercise. 

## Interaction and Assessment

Engage with each caller professionally, as in a real-life office setting. Provide information as you would in a real-life scenario.

_(Added in Wave 2)_ Take in consideration that secretaries should not disclose sensitive or confidential information to unknown callers.

_(Added in Wave 3)_ Examples of information secretaries shouldn't disclose are:
  * Names of employees
  * Direct phone numbers
  * Social security numbers (SSN)
  * Health information
  * Passwords
  * Private addresses

_(Added in Wave 4)_ Please be aware that Innovatech Solutions has been a victim of social engineering attacks via phone calls, and its employees have the responsibility to protect the company's sensitive information.

## Role-Playing and Realism

It is crucial to treat this exercise with the seriousness and professionalism of real-life job responsibilities. Respond to each caller's needs accurately.

## Completion of Exercise

Interact with all three callers to complete the exercise.
If you feel like the call has already completed its objective, feel free to hang up.
After the series of calls, we will ask for feedback and a brief summary of the interactions.
